  shortDescription:
    "Master Rust programming with a strong focus on performance, memory safety, concurrency, and real-world system-level applications.",

  overview: [
    "This Rust Programming course is designed to introduce learners to Rust as a modern, system-level programming language focused on safety, speed, and concurrency without a garbage collector. The program covers Rust fundamentals, ownership model, and advanced language features used in real-world applications.",
    "Throughout the course, students will gain hands-on experience with Rust syntax, ownership and borrowing, error handling, concurrency, and memory management. Emphasis is placed on writing safe, efficient, and scalable code using Rust’s unique programming paradigm.",
    "With practical exercises, mini projects, and a capstone application, learners will be prepared for roles involving system programming, backend services, high-performance applications, and modern software development using Rust."
